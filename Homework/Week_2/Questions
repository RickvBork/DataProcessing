1. Double char boolean checks are type converting checks, e.g. '001' == 1; Because JS
    converts the types to compare them equeally. But they are not always truly equal,
    triple char boolean checks are strict, they do not convert types and thus values must be truly equeal.
    e.g. '001' == 1 (true) but '001' === 1 (false).

2. A closure is a function within a function that gives access to the outer functions scope. So even if the
    function that created the variable is returned, the local variable is still accessable if the inner function has been
    mapped to a variable.

3. Functions that operate on other functions are called Higher Order Functions, these abstract the meaning of the underlying code block.
    Code containing a million rules can be condensed into 1 or 2 higher order functions for ultimate abstraction.

4. querySelector() is a method of the document Object/Class that selects a given CSS attributes.
    e.g. document.querySelector('h1.choose me!'), selects the first (AND only the first!) h1 tag and the first
    'choose me! class within it.
